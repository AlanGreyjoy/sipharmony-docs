Let's discover **how easy it is to start communicating with Sipharmomy**.

Sipharmony is a comprehensive communication platform designed to streamline and simplify your communication needs. It offers a range of features including voice calls, video calls, and instant messaging, all in one easy-to-use interface.

## Mobile & Desktop Apps

Mobile and desktop apps are for now, tricky. In the past, we would register customers with our whitelabel provider "Ringotel". However, there are too many bugs and unsolved issues with the Ringotel apps. We are currently working on our own mobile and desktop apps. In the meantime, we recommend using the [Zoiper](https://www.zoiper.com/en/voip-softphone/download/current) softphone. It is free and works great with Sipharmony.

You can find your SIP credentials in your account dashboard under **Users**.

**Full Disclosure:**

We are not affiliated with Zoiper in any way. We just think it is a great softphone.

**Sipharmony's commitment to transparency:**

Currently, unlimited customers have access to the Sipharmony mobile and desktop apps. Although, new unlimited customers will not be added. This is because Ringotel charges us per user. So making this available to pay-as-you-go customers just isn't possible.

Another huge reason is Sipharmony SMS/MMS and Ringotel SMS/MMS are not compatible. This means that if you send an SMS/MMS from the Sipharmony mobile app, it will not show up in the Sipharmony Web App. This is a huge problem for us and our customers.

Lastly, complete system control. There is no way to add our own features to the Ringotel apps. We are limited to what they offer. This is not good for us or our customers.

However, we are working on our own mobile and desktop apps. Once these are ready, we will make them available to all customers free of charge!!

**SMS/MMS Zoiper:**

Zoiper does not support "carrier" SMS/MMS. However, it does support "SIP SIMPLE" SMS. This was only recently discovered by one of our customers that loves to test and push our systems limits! We are currently working on a way to make this work with Sipharmony. We will update this documentation once we have a solution.

## Webphone

The webphone is a great way to make and receive calls from your browser. It is a great alternative to the mobile and desktop apps. It is also a great way to make and receive calls from your computer if you don't have a headset or microphone.
