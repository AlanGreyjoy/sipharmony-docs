# API Documentation

Our API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies and JSON request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

We have choosen to use Stoplight for our API documentation.

We love Stoplight because it allows us to create a beautiful, functional, and easy to use API documentation.

We hope you enjoy it as much as we do and we look forward to hearing your feedback.

**You can view our API documentation at [https://sipharmony.stoplight.io/](https://sipharmony.stoplight.io/)**
