# What are recordings?

Recordings are audio files that you can use for your IVR menus, voicemail greetings, and call queues.

You can record your own recordings or you can use our text-to-speech engine to generate a recording for you. You can also upload your own recording.

:::tip
You can use the same recording for multiple IVR menus, voicemail greetings, and call queues.
