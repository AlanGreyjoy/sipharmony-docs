# What is an IVR Menu?

An IVR menu is a menu that is played to the caller when they call your number. It is a series of options that the caller can choose from. For example, "Press 1 for Sales, Press 2 for Support, Press 3 for Billing, Press 4 for Accounts, Press 5 for Marketing, Press 6 for HR, Press 7 for Reception, Press 8 for the Operator, Press 9 to leave a voicemail".

## Recordings

You can record your own IVR menu or you can use our text-to-speech engine to generate a recording for you. You can also upload your own recording.
